This is a simple vertical shooter game similar to old games like Xenon. 

It was used a demo for a public session on programming simple games
conducted at [The
Lycaeum](http://thelycaeum.in/blog/2014/09/01/public_sessions/) in
Sep/2014.

The whole game was built from scratch in about two hours describing
the process.
